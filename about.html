                    <h3>Hi I am Glen from the USA</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have been living in Japan since 2018. When I first moved here I spend two years in a language school in Nippori Tokyo. I entered into Tokyo International Univseristy in 2020 right after the COVID-19 pandemic was getting going. Because of that this has been my 1st semester will all in person classes. This was my last semester and assuming I pass all my classes I will be graduating on March 16th.

                    <h3>Job Hunting</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since this has been my last semester of school I have been on the job hunting grind. Much of my free time when not working on homework has been doing various job interviews, writing and rewriting resumes and spending time with my girlfirend. I am excited and anxious for what the future holds for me and what kind of job I will be able to work come graduation.
