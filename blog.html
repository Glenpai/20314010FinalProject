						<h3>New Year Beach Trip</h3>
						<span>Posted : Dec 31, 2023</span> <img src="images/swimming.jpg" class="resize-400px" alt="">

							For new years, I went to Oarai with some friends to see a shine on the beach. The waves were beautiful and the beach was made up of mostly small rocks that made a wonderful rainlike sound as the waves crashed upon them. We had plans to see more of the city but my friends and I ended up spending two hours just watching the waves, talking, and listening to the sound of the falling pebbles. It was a wonderful experience.

							Ever since I got my Japanese driver's license two years ago day trips like this have made for some of my best memories In Japan. Having come from a small town in the United States surrounded by nature, I find that Tokyo at times can be overwhelming and an excursion into nature that the surrounding countryside has to offer is always a great fix.
