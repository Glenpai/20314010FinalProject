                            This is my personal website I had to make for my final project. My name is Glen Hardin and my student number is 20314010. Above is a picture of my girlfriend and myself. For the JS requirement, I added a button to show time and date to the bottom of the page. For CSS, I spent a great deal of time figuring out how to resize my images and change the colors of fonts and styles. It did not turn out exactly how I wanted it to but I learned alot though my trial and error.

                            My girlfriend loves cats! Since we are not allowed to have animals in our apartment, we often go to cat cafes to visit with the cats. Here is a cute picture of some cats from the cat cafe snuggling.

                            My girlfriend's parents came to Japan a few months ago, and we went to Kawaguchi ko. One of the most delicious restaurants we ate at was an old Japanese tavern that was 400 years old. It was restored, but it still served dinner over an open fire like how the tavern was run centuries ago. The soba there was particularly delicious!
